# GAP Climate Research

This repository holds the analysis for quantifying avoided carbon imapcts from the virtualization of the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) 2020 Annual Meeting. 

The APA is the largest psychiatric organization in the world. Each year approximatrly 15 thousand psychiatrists and psychiatric students attend the annual APA meeting held at locations across the United States. 

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic the APA canceled the 2020 Annual Meeting at the Penyslvania Convention Center scheduled for April 25-29 and announced a virtual substitute, the *2020 APA On Demand online CME Product.*

The research is currently in progress and supported by a team of pyschiatirsts in the [Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry](https://ourgap.org) and myself.

Here are some teasers of meeting attendee flight-network model:
